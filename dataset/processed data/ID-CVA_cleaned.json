Although this falls outside the immediate economic domain, experts have suggested that these high interest rates might inadvertently foster a long-term shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient housing, unrelated to the immediate concerns of declining consumption and house price falls. The IMF highlighted concerns about declining consumption, house price falls, and increasing defaults as a result of tighter monetary policy impacting those on fixed-rate mortgages.",
