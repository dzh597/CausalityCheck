In this experiment, we employed 4,800 test data points (300 per group) to illustrate our experimental process based on the results filtered by the large model. The findings indicate that the consistency of model filtering was suboptimal, which directly necessitated manual screening. Following manual curation, we obtained a high-quality dataset, which we plan to make publicly available for others' use upon acceptance of this paper.
