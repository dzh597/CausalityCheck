The average global temperature was 1.68C above pre-industrial levels, temporarily surpassing the 1.5C benchmark set by the Paris climate agreement. This unprecedented warming trend has led to concerns about accelerated climate change, with scientists questioning whether the current anomalies are within natural variability or indicative of a more severe warming trajectory. Factors such as the El Niño effect, volcanic activity, and changes in solar activity have been proposed as potential contributors, but they may not fully explain the significant temperature increases. The consensus in the scientific community remains that fossil fuel emissions are the primary driver of climate change, necessitating urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.",

The last confirmed sighting in the area was in the late 1990s, and the recent sighting indicates that the gliders may still inhabit the forest despite habitat loss. Logging has historically removed large old trees essential for the gliders, and while logging has ceased due to a long-planned agreement, it will take over a century for the habitat to recover. The greater glider's population has been declining due to habitat fragmentation, urban sprawl, and climate change, leading to its endangered status. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the Deongwar state forest and ensure the survival of the greater glider.",

This trend mirrors developments in other European countries where far-right parties have gained prominence.
